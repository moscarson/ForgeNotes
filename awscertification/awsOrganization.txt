Global Infrastructure

	Availability Zone (AZ)
		physically separated and isolated Availability Zones
		connected with fiber optic low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking
	Edge locations 	
		Datacenter that does not contain any AWS services
		Currently 96+ edge locations throughout the world
		used to deliver content to parts of world without AWS services
		Put close to customers who want to access data
		store static files to reduce latency to those users
		End points for AWS used for caching content
		e.g. CloudFront – Amazon’s Content Delivery Network (CDN)
	Regions
		geographical area
		Each region consists of 2 or more AZs		
		Some services do work globally and not just in a region (e.g. IAM)
		Comprised of availability zones
			One or more in each region
			Physically separate from each other 
			Low latency connection between AZs
			AZs are made up of one or more data centers
		made up of availability zones
			independent data centers
			applications use multiple AZs to provide failover and load balancing
			If one AZ becomes unavailable, it can failover to another AZ
			direct low latency connections between each
		put servers in the region closest to the users
		some laws require systems in a certain location
			e.g. some countries in Europe require all data to be housed in that country
		when viewing a region in the AWS console, you see all AZs in that region
		some AWS services work globally and not tied to a region
			IAM users
			although users can be restricted to a certain region
