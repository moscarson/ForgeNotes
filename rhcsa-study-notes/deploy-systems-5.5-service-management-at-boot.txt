# system configuration based on targets
# whenever a service moves into a given target, all services associated with that target are started 

# install apache
yum -y install httpd

# check status
systemctl is-enabled httpd
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep httpd

# start service
systemctl start httpd

# stop service
systemctl stop httpd

# configure service to start at boot
# make sure you are in the target in which you want it to be enabled in

# check target mode
systemctl get-default

# changing target (i.e. change current run level)
systemctl set-default multi-user.target
systemctl set-default graphical.target
systemctl set-default basic.target

# enable it in that target
# enabling it will create script in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants
systemctl enable httpd

# check directory. 
# everything there is enabled
ls /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants

# what target does service belong to
systemctl list-dependencies | grep httpd

# Lists currently loaded target units
systemctl list-units --type target	

# during certification exam, reboot system and check if service is running
reboot
systemctl status httpd
