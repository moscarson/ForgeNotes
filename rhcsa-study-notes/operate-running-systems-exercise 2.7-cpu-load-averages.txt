Per CPU load average calculation formula: load average / # of cpu
Per CPU load average calculation 1 Minute load average: 1.04 / 2 = 52%
Per CPU load average calculation 5 Minute load average: .72 / 2 = 36%
Per CPU load average calculation 15 Minute load average: .35 / 2 = 17.5%

# get number of CPUs
grep "model name" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l

# calculate true load average
divide load average from top by number of CPUs to get actual CPU load average
